# Dashboard & Live Activity

The Dashboard is your command center for monitoring the AI agent's work and managing your analyzed emails.

## 📊 Recent Analysis

As the agent processes your inbox, emails appear live in this list. 

*   **Real-time Refresh**: New emails pop up at the top automatically as they are analyzed.
*   **Categories**: The AI automatically assigns categories like `Client`, `Internal`, or `Support`.
*   **Summaries**: Instead of reading long threads, you can see a one-sentence AI summary and key points.

## 🕵️ AI Trace & Transparency

One of the core philosophies of Email Automator is transparency.

1.  **AI Trace (Eye Icon)**: Click this on any email card to see exactly what the AI was thinking. It shows:
    *   The exact prompt sent to the LLM.
    *   The raw JSON response from the model.
    *   Every granular step (Fetching → Analyzing → Acting).
2.  **Live Agent Terminal**: Click the floating "Live Activity" button in the bottom right to see a scrolling log of the agent's current background activity.

## ⚡ Manual Actions

You can quickly process your analyzed emails using the toolbar on each card:

*   🗑️ **Delete**: Trashes the email in your Gmail/Outlook account.
*   📦 **Archive**: Moves the email out of your Inbox.
*   🚩 **Flag/Star**: Highlights the email for later.
*   📖 **Mark as Read**: Clears the unread status.
*   🔗 **External Link**: Opens the specific email thread directly in Gmail or Outlook.

## 🤖 Smart Drafts

If an email requires a response, the AI will generate a **Smart Draft**. 
*   You can preview this draft in the "Email Details" sidebar.
*   The draft is automatically saved in your **Drafts** folder at your email provider—simply open the thread and hit Send!
